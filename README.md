**JSON verify**

The verify_json function checks recursively whether the field 'Resource' contains '*'.

To run unittests you need to download both files: 'main.py' and 'test.py' to the same directory and then run 'test.py' with python3.

You can add other examples of JSON which you want to check in this file.
